# Crop-Yield-Analysis
# 📊 Crop Yield Analysis

A comprehensive agricultural data analysis project that explores crop production patterns, relationships between key agricultural variables, and insightful visualizations using Python and Power BI. This repository includes raw data, analysis notebook, Power BI dashboard, and project documentation.

## 🧾 Project Overview

Crop Yield Analysis aims to understand how various factors — such as cultivated area, rainfall, fertilizer usage, pesticide usage, and crop type — influence agricultural productivity. The project involves:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Correlation analysis
- Crop-wise, state-wise & year-wise insights
- Interactive visualizations using Power BI

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked data quality and missing values
- Detected and treated outliers using IQR method
- Checked skewness and distribution of features

### 📈 Insightful Analyses
- **Correlation analysis** between production, yield, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage
- **Crop-wise yield comparison**
- **State-wise production trends**
- **Year-wise change patterns**
- **Input impact analysis** (Fertilizer & Pesticide)

---

## 📌 Insights & Learnings

- Larger cultivated areas result in higher production.
- Greater use of fertilizers and pesticides tends to increase production and yield.
- Fertilizer usage is strongly correlated with pesticide usage.
- Rainfall patterns moderately influence crop yields.
- Production and yield have shown increasing trends over the years.

---

## 📊 Power BI Visualization

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPI cards for Yearly production & yield
- Bar charts (State-wise production, Crop-wise yield)
- Line charts (Trend analyses)
- Scatter plots (Input vs Yield correlations)
- Interactive filters (State, Crop, Year)
